# iDOM (Python)

The server side of iDOM. This is where we create raw DOM models using Python and send
them to the client to be shown on-screen. iDOM requires Python 3.6 and above.


# Early Days

iDOM is still young. If you have ideas or find a bug, be sure to post an
[issue](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom/issues)
or create a
[pull request](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom/pulls).
We need all the help we can get!
